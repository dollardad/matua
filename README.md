matua
=====

WordPress HTML5 Responsive bare bones theme built with sass, compass, susy and break point.

This theme has been designed to be the absolute basic bare bones parent theme for WordPress. I found that to many of the themeframeworks carried to much junk, even theme builders like underscores.me.

I build a lot of WordPress website and at least one theme a week and got tried of fighting the parent them. I do not use theme option as they are unnecessary in our workflow, once the theme has been designed by a graphic designer then we just need a bare bones template to start working on.

The word Matua is Maori (New Zealand) for Parent.

This theme is released under the GPL 2 licence - you are free to do what ever you want except complain - this theme suits my workflow.
